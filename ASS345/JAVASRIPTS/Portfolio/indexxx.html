            Most companies have some sort of core values or principles. These
            are usually five or six points that guide your culture and business
            philosophy. These are often treated like something that’s pinned on
            the wall and forgotten, existing only because someone decided they
            needed to one day. But, when they’re thoughtfully crafted and
            ingrained into how your company operates, they can be powerful
            guideposts for how employees should approach their work and your
            customers.
